			This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
			made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A
			more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta
			but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese
			and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy
			green salad and crusty garlic bread.
